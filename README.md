Record parent [`tracing::Span`] fields from inside child [`tracing::Span`]'s context.




## Motivation

Dealing with the complex relationship in the hierarchy of nested [`Span`]s in [`tracing`] may become quite cumbersome. When faced with the need to record a new value for a field of a [`Span`] _higher in the tree_, users have no choice but to refactor their code in some way to allow that. This includes:

1. Extracting a [`Span::record`] out of the child [`Span`]:
   ```rust
   fn called_from_withing_a_span() {
       let id = 42;
       tracing::Span::current().record("id", id);

       tracing::info_span!("child").in_scope(|| {
           // ...
       })
   }
   ```
   Which doesn't work when:
   - There is another "layer" of [`Span`]s between them;
   - The value that needs to be recorded is computed in the function (you may still be able to work around by returning from `in_scope` closure);
   - The parent [`Span`] is in another crate you have no control of.

2. Bringing the parent [`Span`] to the child:
   ```rust
   fn parent() {
       let parent_span = tracing::info_span!(
            "parent",
            id = tracing::field::Empty,
       );
       let _entered = parent_span.enter();
       child(parent_span.clone());
   }

   #[tracing::instrument(skip_all)]
   fn child(parent_span: tracing::Span) {
       let id = 42;
       parent_span.record("id", id);
   }
   ```
   We had to construct a `parent` [`Span`] using `*_span!` macro and pass it to the child.

Those workarounds are not ergonomic. Furthermore, in some cases cannot be used at all.




## Overview

This crate adds a [`HierarchicalRecord`] [`Layer`] and a [`SpanExt`] trait with the [`record_hierarchical()`] method that can be used as a drop-in replacement for a [`Span::record`].


### Usage

Add the [`HierarchicalRecord`] [`Layer`] to your [subscriber]:
```rust
# use tracing_subscriber::prelude::*;
use tracing_record_hierarchical::HierarchicalRecord;

fn init_tracing() {
    tracing_subscriber::registry()
        .with(HierarchicalRecord::default())
        .init();
}
```

Whenever you're to use a [`Span::record`] to record a value to a parent [`Span`]'s field, call the [`record_hierarchical()`] method instead, or a panicking [`must_record_hierarchical()`] version instead:
```rust
use tracing_record_hierarchical::SpanExt as _;

#[tracing::instrument(fields(foo = tracing::field::Empty))]
fn foo() {
    bar();
}

#[tracing::instrument]
fn bar() {
    tracing::Span::current()
        // This walks up the hierarchy of `Span`s from the `span` the method 
        // was called on (`current()` in this example) to the "root" `Span`. 
        // If some `Span` in the hierarchy has the `foo` field, the provided 
        // value will be recorded there. If none of the `Span`s in the 
        // hierarchy has this field, a panic will occur.
        .must_record_hierarchical("foo", 42);
}
#
# fn main() {
#     use tracing_subscriber::prelude::*;
#     use tracing_record_hierarchical::HierarchicalRecord;
# 
#     tracing_subscriber::registry().with(HierarchicalRecord::default()).init();
# 
#     foo();
# }
```
